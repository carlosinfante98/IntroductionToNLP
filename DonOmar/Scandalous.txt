 Saquen los habanos...
Que se juntaron el boricua y el cubano...
Para darse la mano...
Latino, somos familia mi hermano...
(Aguanta la pela!)

(Aguanta la pela!)She's so scandalous, so bad for me
Y le temo a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aquí
I can't handle this, she's more than me
Y le temo a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aquí
She's so scandalous, so bad for me
Y le temo a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aquí
I can't handle this, she's more than me
Y le temo a pensar que me puede matar el no verla aquí(Yo!) Bori, shorty's a naughty one
All she wants is a forty and a blunt
An audience in front just to get the party crunked
Some rump shakin' reggaeton and some Puerto Rican rum
A thong and a pair of pumps to freak it when she's drunk
And it's done, I got it all recorded by the tons
Even caught it in the buns for the right amount of funds
She stunts just for the fun of it
Her story's just a front for the chumps
I'm the one who taught her how to hump
How to pump, how to bump and grind
From front and from behind
How to become a dime, shine, and become one of a kind
Now she's somethin' fine, sweeter than dunkin' Heinz
Trying to pump your mind up to sign on that dotted line
And I ain't havin' it...
She's only for the baggin' it and stabbin' it
The broad seen more drawers than a cabinet
To put a cap in it...
She tapped the whole hood like any hoe would
I tell you she's no good...

El no verla aqui, el no verla aquí...(Yo!) Dog, you part of my fam'
You my man, understand nigga'
Handle this, the word in Los Angeles
She's bangin' in sand wishes
My man and them ran a triz
She's taking a gang of dicks from them amateurs
A star with a scandalous nature
And nothin' you can do about it
Cuz you already knew about it before you even started
And you still tryin' to change her
And turn her to your loyal goddess
Don't be modest, whatever she wanted she got it
But she still went on and played ya
And now you wanna pout about it
Thought that she was 'bout it 'bout it
Gave her your heart but she just wanted your paper
I told you, you could do without it
You was just a fool who doubted, but you allowed it
Don't worry about it, you just wake up

El no verla aqui, el no verla aquí...I'm pretty sure I've seen her face before
In a different place before and it's not déja vü
I could have sworn that we blazed before
Back in the days on tour, shorty, I know you
Now, I knew I've seen her face before
She was that crazy broad
Who went and blazed the whole crew
I don't have to trace her face no more
I rest my case, I'm sure
Girl, you know it's true
I'm pretty sure I've seen her face before
In a different place before and it's not déja vü
I could have sworn that we blazed before
Back in the days on tour, shorty, I know you
