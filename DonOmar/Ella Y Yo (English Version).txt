I never fail you
They betrayed me the desire to see her again
And although I still can not believe
What this bitter encounter
It made me understand
Well you also arrived at that place
Where many times I went to look for her
And although it's not easy what I'm going to do
I'll admit that I went out with your wife

When she told me she was going to puerto ricoOn vacation with her friend
She lied to me
You and she in a bed there in bayamon
Maybe in isla verde or carolina
How many hotels are dirty
You also hate them both
That I am the one who most suffer with all this
The pain kills me
(It was a betrayal)
I lost a friend because of temptation
Sorry
