 When you're gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, Donde voy
Don't let go, Donde voy sin tu amor

When you're gonna stop breaking my heart
I don't wanna be another one

Don't let go, Donde voy
Don't let go, Donde voy sin tu amor
I don't wanna be another one
Paying for the things I never done
Don't let go, Donde voy
Don't let go, Donde voy sin tu amorEdward Maya
